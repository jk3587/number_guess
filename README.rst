==============================
Simple number guessing program
==============================

------------
How it works
------------
Program generates a random integer between [1, 100]
and the user tries to guess the value.
After every incorrect attempt, the program will
provide a hint to the user by saying the
guessed value is higher or lower than the correct value.

After the user guesses the correct value, the program
will congratulate the user, display the correct
value and the number of guesses, and ask if the user
wishes to play another game or quit.
